    [`blueprint cinder-consistency-groups <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/horizon/+spec/cinder-consistency-groups>`_]
    This feature adds 2 new tabs to the Project Volumes panel. The first tab will display
    Consistency Groups, and the second tab will display Consistency Group Snapshots.
    Consistency Groups (CG) contain existing volumes, and allow the user to perform
    actions on the volumes in one step. Actions include: create/update/delete CGs,
    snapshot all volumes in a CG, clone all volumes in a CG, and create a new CG and
    volumes from a CG snapshot.

    Policies associated with Consistency Groups exist in the Cinder policy file, and
    by default, all actions are disabled.
