upgrade:
  - It is no longer necessary to include the version suffix into
    OPENSTACK_KEYSTONE_URL setting. Thanks to a recent update of
    django-openstack-auth library as of 2.3.0 release, Horizon will
    append the proper version suffix to the URL based on the value
    stored inside OPENSTACK_API_VERSIONS['identity'] setting.
fixes:
  - LP-1585682 is fixed which grants Horizon the ability to properly version
    Keystone webpath endpoints (URLs like http://<hostip>/identity instead of
    http://<hostip>:5000).
