prelude: >
    Angular actions now should return a promise
    that resolves with an object structured in a way
    to indicate what the action did (or didn't do).
features:
  - An action-result service provides convenience methods
    for construction of the result, and for parsing of
    a resolved object
upgrade:
  - Although it's not required, it's best to make your
    actions return promises with the expected structure.
