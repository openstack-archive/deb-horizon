    The Images panel now may be configured to use
    either the legacy or Angular code.
features:
  - the ``ANGULAR_FEATURES`` setting now allows for a key
    ``images_panel``. If set to ``True``, then the Angular
    Images panel will be used, while the Python version will
    be used if set to ``False``.
  - Integration tests for Image features may also be toggled
    in openstack_dashboard/test/integration_tests/horizon.conf
    using the 'panel_type' feature, either set to 'legacy' or
    'angular' to match the enabled panel type.
