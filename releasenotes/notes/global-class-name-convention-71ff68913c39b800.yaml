prelude: >
    In an effort to standarize our HTML class naming
    conventions, we will be updating various class
    names to use dashes, instead of underscore or
    camelcasing, to match with Bootstrap's convention.
deprecations:
  - All instances of HTML class 'd3_pie_chart_usage' to 'pie-chart-usage'
    All instances of HTML class 'd3_pie_chart_distribution' to 'pie-chart-distribution'
