upgrade:
  - The developer enabled files have been moved from
    ``openstack_dashboard/enabled`` to
    ``openstack_dashboard/contrib/developer/enabled``. To enable them, copy
    into ``openstack_dashboard/local/enabled`` and set ``DEBUG = True``.
fixes:
  - There will no longer be any ``WARNING`` messages regarding
    the developer panels in logs.
