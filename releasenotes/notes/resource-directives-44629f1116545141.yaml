    Angular components now exist to provide simple-to-
    configure panels and tables, based off of registry
    information about resources (e.g. Instances).
features:
  - The hz-resource-table directive takes in a Heat
    resource name (e.g. 'OS::Nova::Server') and uses
    the Angular registry to provide actions, columns,
    and summary views.
  - The hz-resource-panel directive takes in a Heat
    resource name (e.g. 'OS::Nova::Server') and
    displays an appropriate header and allows content
    to be transcluded to build the panel page.
