    To aid in continued maintenance of Horizon as
    a themable and customizable framework, the highly
    customized 'default' styles are being dropped in
    favor of standard Bootstrap styles. The 'default'
    theme will only house scss variable changes going
    forward.
upgrade:
  - If the 'default' theme is still required for legacy
    overrides to function, simply copy the styles in
    the 'default' theme into a pre-existing theme or
    create a new custom theme.
