upgrade:
  - The ``TEMPLATE_*`` settings have been replaced with a ``TEMPLATE`` dict.
    This will likely cause issues when porting settings to this version of
    Horizon. The TEMPLATE_DEBUG setting has been removed and is tied to
    the DEBUG setting now. A detailed explanation of this dict can be found at
    https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/1.10/ref/settings/#templates
  - The ``is_authenticated()`` and ``is_anonymous()`` functions in Django
    OpenStack Auth's ``User`` class are properties when running under Django
    1.10, and no longer take a margin parameter.
