prelude: >
    A Details page for a resource type (e.g. Images)
    may now use the Angular application-level registry
    to register views so developers may easily create
    or extend details views. In this implementation
    these views are presented as tabs within the
    Details page.
features:
  - A directive (hz-details) provides the ability to
    intelligently display a set of views (typically for
    a Details context).
  - A generic Details display parses the location to
    determine the resource type, and displays relevant
    details views for that type.
  - A Descriptor concept allows convenient passing of
    information that can globally identify an object,
    for use in generic views and actions.
  - Horizon now has a (non-navigational) route in Django
    so generic details pages are deep-linked.
  - A shared Django template is now available for use by
    any Angular page.
upgrade:
  - (optional) Use the common Angular template as the
    basis of any Angular pages to minimize boilerplate code
    and to ensure that we use similar features/framing.
