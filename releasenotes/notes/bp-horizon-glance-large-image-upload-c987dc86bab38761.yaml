features:
  - Create from a local file feature is added to both Angular and Django
    Create Image workflows. It works either in a 'legacy' mode
    which proxies an image upload through Django, or in a new
    'direct' mode, which in turn implements
    [`blueprint horizon-glance-large-image-upload
    <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/horizon/+spec/horizon-glance-large-image-upload>`_].
    To use the direct mode HORIZON_IMAGES_UPLOAD_MODE setting
    should be changed to 'direct' value along with changing
    glance-api.conf cors.allowed_origin parameter to the URL
    from which Horizon is served.
deprecations:
  - HORIZON_IMAGES_ALLOW_UPLOAD setting is deprecated and
    should be gradually replaced with
    HORIZON_IMAGES_UPLOAD_MODE setting.
