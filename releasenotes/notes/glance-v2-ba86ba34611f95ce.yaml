features:
  - Adds complete support for Glance v2 so that Horizon no longer depends on
    having a Glance v1 endpoint in the Keystone catalog. Also provides
    code compatibility between Glance v1 and v2.
  - Adds a new config value called IMAGES_ALLOW_LOCATION, which allows users
    to set locations when creating or updating images. Depending on the Glance
    version, the ability to set locations is controlled by policies and/or
    configuration values.
upgrade:
  - The OPENSTACK_IMAGE_FORMATS variable must be added to the
    REST_API_REQUIRED_SETTINGS setting in local_settings.py
issues:
  - If you set 'images_panel' to False for the ANGULAR_FEATURES option (which
    is not the default) and configure Horizon to use Glance v2, Ramdisk ID and
    Kernel ID don't show properly on the "Edit Image" screen.
other:
  - Glance v2 doesn't support the copy-from feature, so this feature is
    disabled in Horizon when using Glance v2.
