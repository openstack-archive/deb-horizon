    [`blueprint navigation-improvements <https://blueprints.launchpad.net/horizon/+spec/navigation-improvements>`_] Breadcrumb navigation has been added across Horizon.

upgrade:
  - The breadcrumb navigation inside the details pages now applies across
    Horizon. A small change in the logic means that ``custom_breadcrumb``
    items in the context no longer need to specify the panel name and link.
