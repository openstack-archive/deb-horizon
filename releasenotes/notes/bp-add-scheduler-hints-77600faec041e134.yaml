features:
  - Added the Scheduler Hints tab to the new Launch Instance workflow to allow
    adding scheduler hints to an instance at launch. In addition to adding
    custom key-value pairs, the user can also choose from properties in the
    glance metadata definitions catalog that have the OS::Nova::Server resource
    type and scheduler_hints properties target.
  - Added settings support to the angular workflow service so each step in a
    workflow can specify a boolean setting that must pass in order for the step
    to be displayed.
