features:
  - Add a new setting OVERVIEW_DAYS_RANGE.
    It defines the default date range in the Overview panel meters - either
    today minus N days (if the value is integer N), or from the beginning of
    the current month until today (if set to None). This setting is be used to
    limit the amount of data fetched by default when rendering the Overview
    panel. The default value is 1, which differs from the past behaviour, since
    it caused serious lags on large deployments.
