features:
  - Added new setting INTEGRATION_TESTS_SUPPORT, default value
    is `False`. This value is used when running `manage.py compress`
    command, so by default all static assets and html classes used
    by integration tests are removed from Horizon production build.
    Integration tests gate job sets this variable to `True` and
    recompresses static assets.
