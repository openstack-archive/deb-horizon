  * Now writing css and js script in /var, plus we aren't doing chown www-data
  of all the static, but only css + js in /var.
  * Now asking using debconf if we should disable the default apache vhost,
  and activate the Dasboard, and if we should use SSL or not.
  * Added missing dependency on node-less.
  * The package had only Build-Depends:, now setting lots of them in
  Build-Depends-Indep: as it should be.

    configured in debug mode and will serve the static files. However,
