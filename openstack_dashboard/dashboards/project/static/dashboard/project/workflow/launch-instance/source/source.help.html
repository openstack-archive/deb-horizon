  <h4 translate>Instance Details</h4>

  <p translate>An instance name is required and used to help you uniquely identify your instance in the dashboard.</p>

  <p translate><li><b>Image</b>: This option uses an image to boot the instance.</li></p>
  <p translate><li><b>Instance Snapshot</b>: This option uses an instance snapshot to boot the instance.</li></p>
  <p translate>If you want to create an instance that uses persistent storage, meaning the instance data is saved when the instance is deleted, then select one of the following boot options:</p>
  <p translate><li><b>Image (with Create New Volume checked)</b>: This options uses an image to boot the instance, and creates a new volume to persist instance data. You can specify volume size and whether to delete the volume on termination of the instance.</li></p>
